# sensors
Provides a common wrapper around micro:bit and Jacdac SimpleSensorClient sensors. These sensor objects are created by factories using the sensors name or jacdac object. The sensor object specifies metadata such as the minimum and maximum possible readings, sensor error on reading. Methods are provided to log data, read normalised values and push data to a buffer.
